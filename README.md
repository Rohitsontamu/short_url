# Short URL - Simple URL Shortener

A minimal Flask web app that turns long URLs into short ones. Built for simplicity and easy AWS deployment using Terraform.

## What it does

This app takes a long URL and creates a short version. When someone clicks the short link, it redirects them to the original URL.

**Live Demo**: Currently deployed on AWS EC2 at `http://13.127.196.78:5000`

## Features

- âœ… Simple URL shortening with just one input box
- âœ… In-memory storage (no database setup needed)
- âœ… Automatic redirect to original URLs
- âœ… One-command AWS deployment with Terraform
- âœ… Minimal resource usage (perfect for t3.micro free tier)

## What I learned building this

- **Flask web development**: Simple Python web apps
- **AWS EC2 deployment**: Running apps in the cloud
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Using Terraform for AWS resources
- **User-data scripting**: Automated server setup
- **Security groups**: AWS firewall configuration

## Quick Start

### ðŸš€ AWS Deployment (Recommended)

Deploy to AWS EC2 in one command:

```powershell
# Load AWS credentials and deploy
.\deploy.ps1
```

**What you get:**
- Single EC2 instance (t3.micro - free tier eligible)
- Security group with HTTP access on port 5000
- SSH access for troubleshooting
- Estimated cost: ~$8-12/month (free with AWS free tier)

**Prerequisites:**
- AWS CLI configured (`aws configure`)
- Terraform installed
- Your AWS credentials in `.env` file

### ðŸ’» Local Development

1. **Get the code**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd short_url
   ```

2. **Install Flask**:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

3. **Run the minimal app**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the simple app from terraform/main.tf user_data section
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser**: Go to http://localhost:5000



## How to use it

1. **Visit the app** in your browser (locally at http://localhost:5000 or your AWS deployment URL)
2. **Enter a URL** in the input box
3. **Click "Shorten"** to get your short URL
4. **Use the short URL** anywhere - it will redirect to your original URL

## How it works

The app creates a simple form with one input box. When you submit a URL:
1. It generates a random 4-character code
2. Stores the mapping in memory (dictionary)
3. Returns a short URL using that code
4. When someone visits the short URL, it redirects to the original

## Project structure

```
short_url/
â”œâ”€â”€ terraform/            # AWS infrastructure
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf          # Terraform configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ variables.tf     # Input variables
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ outputs.tf       # Output values
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                 # AWS credentials (not in git)
â”œâ”€â”€ deploy.ps1           # One-command deployment script
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py              # Original Flask app (not used in deployment)
â”œâ”€â”€ handlers/            # Original code structure (not used in deployment)
â”œâ”€â”€ web/                 # Original templates (not used in deployment)
â””â”€â”€ README.md            # This file
```

**Note**: The deployed version uses a minimal inline Flask app defined in the Terraform `user_data` section for simplicity and to avoid AWS user-data size limits.



## Troubleshooting

### App not accessible
- Check the security group allows traffic on port 5000
- Verify the EC2 instance is running: `terraform show`
- Check the user-data script ran: SSH into the instance and check logs

### Deployment fails
```powershell
# Check AWS credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Check Terraform state
cd terraform
terraform plan

# Destroy and recreate if needed
terraform destroy -auto-approve
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

### SSH into the server
```bash
# Use the SSH command from terraform output
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ec2-user@<your-server-ip>

# Check if the app is running
ps aux | grep python
netstat -tulpn | grep 5000
```

## Technical Details

- **Runtime**: Python 3 with Flask
- **Storage**: In-memory dictionary (resets on server restart)
- **Server**: Single EC2 t3.micro instance
- **Security**: AWS Security Group allows HTTP on port 5000 and SSH on port 22
- **Region**: ap-south-1 (Mumbai) - change in `terraform/variables.tf` if needed

## What I'd add next

If I expanded this project, I'd add:
- Database persistence (SQLite or RDS)
- Custom short codes
- Click analytics
- URL expiration
- Rate limiting
- Better UI styling
